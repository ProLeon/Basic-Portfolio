                    Hello, I'm Dylan Whipple, I'm 23 years old and I had just move to this bootcamp from Verizon and I was a sales consultant for little
                    over 2 years. I worked at T-Mobile for about a year aswell, prior to that I was a cell tower technician.<br/><br/>
                    That was a little about my past, but for me and things I like, I like to game also develop games a little bit, I also like
                    to snowboard and hang out with my family, that's me! Goodbye.<br/><br/>
                    Here's some random text for the road: A glittering gem is not enough.
                    I am never at home on Sundays.
                    I hear that Nancy is very pretty. Writing a list of random sentences is harder than I initially thought it would be.
                    The memory we used to share is no longer coherent.
                    The lake is a long way from here.
